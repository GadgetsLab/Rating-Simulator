Hello Duque, it's me, the great programmer, Sir Dan.
This is I did:
- I tried to get better the template with ED-GRID, but the "ed-container" no divided well. Please, check it out.
- I adapted the logic for the new template.
- So I tried to adapt a "functions" file. This file have three functions: "showQuestios", "getRespons" and "showAnswers".
In the file (with comments) I explain the functionality of all methods. But the first and third function don't execute.

And no more. Please, question me about something that you don't understand. See ya
